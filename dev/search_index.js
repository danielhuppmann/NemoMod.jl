Essentially, this means it seeks to meet energy and power demands over time at the lowest possible cost. The cost minimization is performed simultaneously for all modeled time periods, and all costs are discounted to the beginning of the simulation. Costs can include investment costs, fixed and variable operation and maintenance costs, and emission penalties for different components of the energy system (such as power plants, energy storage facilities, and transmission lines).","category":"page"},{"location":"model_concept/","page":"Model concept","title":"Model concept","text":"NEMO is a deterministic model, but its robust performance makes it practical to explore uncertainties in inputs, including in a large scenario ensemble analysis framework. It represents an energy system through a series of input dimensions and parameters, calculated variables, constraints, and an objective function. A set of input dimensions and parameters (and optionally custom constraints) for NEMO constitutes a scenario. You define dimensions and parameters for a scenario by specifying them in a NEMO scenario database. Each scenario has its own database, and NEMO writes results to the database when the scenario is calculated.","category":"page"},{"location":"model_concept/","page":"Model concept","title":"Model concept","text":"tip: Tip\nYou can create an empty NEMO scenario database with the createnemodb function.

All NEMO scenarios are driven by some exogenously specified demands, but you can decide how to define these. For instance, demands can be defined for fuels themselves or for energy services that are provided by fuel-consuming devices. Note that NEMO is not a partial-equilibrium model, so it does not incorporate an endogenous demand response to energy supply costs.","category":"page"},{"location":"model_concept/","page":"Model concept","title":"Model concept","text":"NEMO has several features that account for energy system reliability requirements. Most important, you can specify a reserve margin for energy production capacity that must be maintained at times of peak load.

You can vary these parameters across scenarios to test different reliability stressors (including contingency scenarios where certain supply resources are not available).","category":"page"},{"location":"model_concept/","page":"Model concept","title":"Model concept","text":"tip: Tip\nA good idea when testing reliability scenarios is to define a high-cost, always-available supply technology for unmet demand.

In principle, NEMO is compatible with any mixed-integer linear solver that can be called through JuMP (see the JuMP documentation for more details). A solver can be specified when calculating a scenario in NEMO by passing a JuMP Model object that references the solver to NEMO's calculatescenario method.

Saving unnecessary variables increases disk operations and may result in a longer solve time (because additional constraints are needed to calculate the variables).\nDon't save zeros. If you set the reportzeros argument for calculatescenario to false (the default), NEMO won't save output variable values that are equal to zero. This can substantially reduce the time and disk space needed to write scenario outputs.\nCheck restrictvars. The restrictvars argument for calculatescenario can have an important effect on performance. This option tells NEMO to make a greater effort to eliminate unnecessary variables from the model it provides to the solver. This filtering process requires a little time, but it can considerably reduce the solver's work load. In general, the trade-off is advisable for large models (you should set restrictvars to true in these cases) but may not be for very small models (set restrictvars to false in these cases).\nUse parallel processing. NEMO can parallelize certain operations, reducing their run time by spreading the load across multiple processes. To enable parallelization, use the numprocs or targetprocs argument with calculatescenario. numprocs lets you choose the number of parallel processes to run, while with targetprocs you can select specific processes for parallelization by their Julia identifier (see the Julia documentation on distributed computing for more information on process identifiers and initialization). The default value for numprocs is 0, which means NEMO will set the number of parallel processes based your computer's hardware. As needed, it will start additional processes for you.\nNote that numprocs and targetprocs affect parallelization in NEMO's Julia code, but they don't control what happens with the solver. For maximum performance with large models, it's also helpful to use a solver that supports parallelization, such as CPLEX, Gurobi, or Cbc.\nSimplify the scenario. Substantial performance gains can be realized by reducing the number of dimensions in a scenario - for example, decreasing the number of regions, technologies, time slices, years, or nodes. You can also speed up calculations by forgoing nodal transmission modeling. Of course, this approach generally requires trade-offs: a simpler model may not respond as well to the analytic questions you are asking. The goal is to find a reasonable balance between your model's realism and its performance.\nRelax the transmission simulation. If you're simulating transmission, there are some other performance tuning options to consider beyond reducing your model's dimensions. You can change the simulation method with the TransmissionModelingEnabled parameter or use this parameter to model transmission only in selected years. The calculatescenario function also has an argument (continuoustransmission) that determines whether NEMO uses binary or continuous variables to represent the construction of candidate transmission lines. With binary variables (continuoustransmission = false) candidate lines may only be built in their entirety, while with continuous variables (continuoustransmission = true) partial line construction is allowed. Continuous simulations are generally faster but may not be as realistic.\nUse CapacityOfOneTechnologyUnit selectively. This parameter sets the minimum increment for endogenously determined capacity additions for a technology. When it's specified, NEMO uses integer variables to solve for capacity, which increases model solve time. If you don't define CapacityOfOneTechnologyUnit, NEMO solves for technology capacity with continuous variables. This approach assumes that any increment of new capacity is permissible (subject to limits on minimum and maximum capacity and capacity investment - see TotalAnnualMinCapacity, TotalAnnualMaxCapacity, TotalAnnualMinCapacityInvestment, and TotalAnnualMaxCapacityInvestment).\nTry a different solver. The open-source solvers delivered with NEMO (GLPK and Cbc) may struggle with sizeable models. If you have access to one of the commercial solvers NEMO supports (currently, CPLEX, Gurobi, Mosek, and Xpress), it will usually be a better option. If you're choosing between Cbc and GLPK, test both of them to see which performs better for your scenario.","category":"page"},{"location":"time_slicing/","page":"Time slicing","title":"Time slicing","text":"CurrentModule = NemoMod","category":"page"},{"location":"time_slicing/#time_slicing","page":"Time slicing","title":"Time slicing","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"time_slicing/","page":"Time slicing","title":"Time slicing","text":"NEMO provides a flexible mechanism for dividing years into sub-annual periods and modeling energy demand and supply in those periods.

Introduced the numprocs argument, which lets users specify the number of processes to use for parallelized operations. When numprocs is set, NEMO initializes new processes as needed. Refactored the queries in calculatescenario to parallelize as many of them as possible.\nXpress solver: Added Xpress as an officially supported NEMO solver. This includes incorporating Xpress in the Julia system image that's distributed with the NEMO installer program.\nInstaller program enhancements: Upgraded the installer program to facilitate installation when the executing user isn't an operating system administrator. Also improved the integration of the installer program with LEAP.\nGeneral error handling in calculatescenario: Restructured calculatescenario so exceptions are trapped and presented along with information on how to report problems to the NEMO team.\nOther changes: Streamlined NEMO's logic for upgrading legacy database versions in calculatescenario.
